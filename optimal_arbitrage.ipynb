    "This notebook derives a closed-form formula for the optimal input amount in a single-hop arbitrage trade between two Uniswap V2-style liquidity pools. Rather than relying on numerical methods like binary search, I solved the optimization problem analytically, yielding an exact result in O(1) time. The analysis was done under the context of an MEV bot that uses flashloans for all trades."
